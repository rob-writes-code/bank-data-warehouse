# Data Warehouse for a Bank 🏦

In this project, I create a data warehouse for a bank using PostgreSQL, Docker Compose and DBT.

I then create a metrics dashboard using Metabase, offering insights taken from the data warehouse.

The project is presented in a Jupyter notebook, with screenshots showing each stage of the process.
