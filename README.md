# Data Warehouse for a Bank 🏦

In this project, I create a data warehouse for a bank using PostgreSQL, Docker Compose and DBT.

I then create a metrics dashboard using Metabase, offering insights taken from the data warehouse.

The project is presented in a Jupyter notebook, with screenshots showing each stage of the process.

Overview of the project available [here](https://github.com/rob-writes-code/bank-data-warehouse/blob/main/notebooks/bank_data.ipynb).
